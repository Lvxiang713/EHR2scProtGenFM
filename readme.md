# EHR2scProtGen

A PyTorch-based pipeline for generating single-cell protein expression profiles conditioned on electronic health record (EHR) embeddings, combining a CLIP‐style contrastive learning with a Gaussian diffusion model.

## Overview

This project implements:

1. Contrastive learning model structure  
   Learns joint embeddings of EHR vectors and single-cell protein profiles.  

2. Diffusion model  
   A scAtt-Net operating on per‐cell protein features, with timestep embeddings and cross‐attention conditioning on EHR..

## Usage
1. Create a new Conda environment 
```
conda create -n ehr2scprotgen python=3.9.18
conda activate ehr2scprotgen
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 2. Run the generation script
```
python generate.py
```
Then you will get the synthesized data in the sampled_cells folder.

## Example Notebook

A demo notebook is available under example/GenerateExample.ipynb showing:
The procession of loading configs, generating cells conditioned on trained EHR embedding.

## Downstream Analysis Notebook

The contents of notebook folder demonstrates how to evaluate and analyze the generated single-cell data downstream, 
including DataDistribution.ipynb and DownstreamAnalysis.ipynb
